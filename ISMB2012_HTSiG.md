# ISMB 2012 - Long Beach 2012

## High-throughput sequencing special interest group

### Keynote Stanley Nelson - UCLA
#### Clinical Implications of Next Generation Sequencing

The speaker went into Exome sequencing first as a part of clinical diagnostics, listing its advantages and disadvantages. Some interesting points:

- 96% disease causing genes are captured
- CG depletion in capture

As clinical pipeline, they have a rigorous tested, certified and 'calcified' pipeline to get consistent result. They have found quite a bit of causal genes to many different genetic diseases.

Turn-around is around 4-12 weeks, and costs $ 6,500 for a trio (mother, father, child). Around 50% of the time they can provide a valid diagnosis, half of those involve a new gene mutation previously unknown. The speaker continued to expose on several case studies where Exome sequencing showed causal mutation in some developmental issues.The author shows a case where the exome sequencing changed the diagnosis from ALS to a more rare disease, according to a homozygous mutation found in a known causal gene. 

He exposed a paper [Willer et al, Nat Genetics 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22522420) where the clinical sequencing and the research side worked together. This paper found a novel complementation group for Walker-Warburg syndrome. Mainly, the combination of research and clinical diagnostics allowed for the characterization of the novel complementation group, which needed the experiments to validate. 

There are still technical challenges to the work. Alignment issues cause false positive SNPs. Regions of repeats are still difficult to characterize.
