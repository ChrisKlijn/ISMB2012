## High-throughput sequencing special interest group

### Keynote Stanley Nelson - UCLA
#### Clinical Implications of Next Generation Sequencing

The speaker went into Exome sequencing first as a part of clinical diagnostics, listing its advantages and disadvantages. Some interesting points:

- 96% disease causing genes are captured
- CG depletion in capture

As clinical pipeline, they have a rigorous tested, certified and 'calcified' pipeline to get consistent result. They have found quite a bit of causal genes to many different genetic diseases.

Turn-around is around 4-12 weeks, and costs $ 6,500 for a trio (mother, father, child). Around 50% of the time they can provide a valid diagnosis, half of those involve a new gene mutation previously unknown.
