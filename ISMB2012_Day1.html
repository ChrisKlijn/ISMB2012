<h1>ISMB 2012 - Long Beach</h1>

<h2>Main conference - Day 1</h2>

<h3>Keynote</h3>

<h4>Seeing forward by looking back</h4>

<h5>Richard Lathrop, Lawrence Hunter</h5>

<p>The keynote that opened the conference is in honor of the 20th anniversary of the ISMB, so it contains more of a historical overview than direct science. It is presented by two of the founding board members of the ISCB.</p>

<p>Richard Lathrop gave an overview of the beginnings of computational biology, going from preceding meetings and presence of computational biology in literature in the 80s and 90s. Lawrence Hunter took over, and tries to sketch a vision on the future of computational biology. </p>

<p>As his background is in AI, he focuses on its history in computational biology. He predicts that the first true AI 'mind' will be one that thinks about molecular biology. In this fashion, it appears the IBM <strong>Jeopardy</strong> AI 'Watson' will be applied to biomedicine. One thing that makes molecular biology very amenable for AI, is the fact that almost all knowledge is available to machines, in the form of texts, databases etc. This touches on his own work in ontologies and mechanistic explanation of knowledge. He then goes onto some more in-depth discussion of his own work on 'interestingness', which is an automatic evaluation of explanation and judgment statements.</p>
