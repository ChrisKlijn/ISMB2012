<h4>Clinical Implications of Next Generation Sequencing</h4>

<p>The speaker went into Exome sequencing first as a part of clinical diagnostics, listing its advantages and disadvantages. Some interesting points:</p>

<ul>
<li>96% disease causing genes are captured</li>
<li>CG depletion in capture</li>
</ul>

<p>As clinical pipeline, they have a rigorous tested, certified and 'calcified' pipeline to get consistent result. They have found quite a bit of causal genes to many different genetic diseases.</p>

<p>Turn-around is around 4-12 weeks, and costs $ 6,500 for a trio (mother, father, child). Around 50% of the time they can provide a valid diagnosis, half of those involve a new gene mutation previously unknown. The speaker continued to expose on several case studies where Exome sequencing showed causal mutation in some developmental issues.The author shows a case where the exome sequencing changed the diagnosis from ALS to a more rare disease, according to a homozygous mutation found in a known causal gene. </p>

<p>He exposed a paper <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22522420">Willer et al, Nat Genetics 2012</a> where the clinical sequencing and the research side worked together. This paper found a novel complementation group for Walker-Warburg syndrome. Mainly, the combination of research and clinical diagnostics allowed for the characterization of the novel complementation group, which needed the experiments to validate. </p>

<p>There are still technical challenges to the work. Alignment issues cause false positive SNPs. Regions of repeats are still difficult to characterize. </p>
